<p>Goods is a database that stores and categorizes companies by ethical and unethical business practices. Based off of their sustainability, social responsibility, and political activity, each company is held to a set ethical criteria. Every company is given an overall grade to reflect these standards. Each company in our database is held to the same level of accountability.</p>
<p>Ethical consumerism is not as widespread as it should be. Most people today are living in a disconnect from their products; as more and more of our lives are outsourced, we pay less attention to the processes and decisions that go into putting food to our tables and clothes on our backs. We want to combat this blindness. There is good out thereâ€”let's find it together.</p>
<p>Currently, all listed companies are clothing and activewear companies. In the future, we plan to be more inclusive of other industries.</p>
