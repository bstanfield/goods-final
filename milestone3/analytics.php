        <p>This screenshot shows the general site analytics overview. This includes pageviews, total users, sessions,
            new sessions, and more. One of the more interesting stats here is our average session duration, though it
            is likely skewed by our work on the project.<br><br><br>

        <img style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="../images/analytics2.png"><p>Looking at what browsers are
        being used is key. If the
        majority of our users are viewing from Safari and Chrome, then those are the browsers we should focus on
        development early on.</p><br><br>
        <img style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 20px;" src="../images/analytics3.png">
    <p>Ok, this is probably the most skewed of the graphs, mostly because the majority of sessions have been by the
        three of us working on the site. This is easily proven by how many sessions are open for a long period of
        time. But as the site is used, this will even out and show us when people are leaving.<br><br>
